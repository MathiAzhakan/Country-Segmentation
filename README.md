# Country-Segmentation
Description: The project involved clustering 167 countries into different classes based on their GDP, income, imports, exports, life expectancy, inflation, child mortality rate, total fertility rate and health. An NGO which has collected 10 million dollars wanted to know the countries which are in direct need of the aid after a natural calamity.  After performing K means clustering and agglomerative clustering, 3 groups of countries were identified. Class 0 had most of the under developed countries, Class 1 had most of the developing countries and  Class 2 had most of the developed countries. Based on the classes identified, The final conclusion given was that the countries belonging to class 0 needed the aid because they had lowest GDP, income, exports, imports, life expectancy and health, and highest inflation, child mortality and total fertility compared to the other two classes.
